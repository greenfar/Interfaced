Origin Story:
I am a simple man with simple dreams. I want to maintain a neatly organized media library and I want to easily access my new content on my PS3 without having to drill down all the layers of structured folders.

My media consuming habits have been strewn with many manually intensive processes. I have been retrieving media and storing it in a dedicated new arrival folder, which is served with PS3 Media Server. After I watch the show I move the file to a storage folder and add it to my digital library using TV Rename. This process has taken a toll on me.

So I have finally made the jump and migrated to alternative tools which have proved useful in streamlining my media consumption process. The Interfaced script is the conclusion of this process.  

I am a long time fan of PS3 Media Server and the recently forked Universal Media Server. The tool is extremely versatile at serving all types media content to my PS3, however the only feature that I find lacking is support for functional media library indexing.

Plex is an excellent media library host and indexing tool and it happens to support DLNA.  After using Plex for a few weeks I just cant get enough of the various indexing options available (Recently Added, Watched, On Deck, etc.), I just wish the Plex DLNA playback on the PS3 was better (Plex transcodes my media even when PS3 can natively play it).

So I decided that marrying the two provided the best solution that satisfies my nit-picky needs.  This script is my attempt to solving a long sought after solution to a versatile Media Library and Media Server system. This has made my life easier, maybe it will do the same for you.
